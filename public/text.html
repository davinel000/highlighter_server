  <h3>ABOUT</h3>
  <p><strong>Imagine a world where disease reversal is possible.</strong></p>

  <h3>A NEW MODEL</h3>
  <p><strong>Scientific freedom focused on making medicines.</strong></p>
  <p>Altos merges the best of academia and industry to discover and develop medicines that can transform people’s lives. From academia, the freedom to pursue the most challenging problems in biology, and from industry, the drive, mission and focus on patients. This model promotes deep collaborations, and harnesses the passion and commitment required to transform scientific breakthroughs into medicines.</p>

  <h3>DISCOVERY ENGINE</h3>
  <p><strong>Designed to unite great minds.</strong></p>
  <p>Our mission is to reverse disease, injury and the disabilities that occur throughout life by restoring cell health and resilience through cell rejuvenation. Achieving this goal requires more than just great science. It requires a unique work environment; one where diverse perspectives are welcomed to further scientific innovation and inquiry; one where everyone shares a commitment to achieving our mission; and one where big questions are asked and collaboration is embraced throughout our journey of discovery. These qualities are foundational to Altos and we work to make them a reality every day.</p>
  <p><strong>A powerful computational ecosystem.</strong></p>
  <p>Altos embraces machine learning and computation to enhance our ability to understand fundamental biological systems. We are developing multi-scale generative models to unravel the language of cell health, organ health and the complex relationship between them, across biological hierarchies. To build our models, we are generating a significant volume of high-quality data internally while also integrating external data sets. We have established a dynamic and agile computational ecosystem across Altos that links the deep knowledge of our experimental biologists with computational scientists, all focused on our mission.</p>

  <h3>TRANSLATION</h3>
  <p><strong>Translating breakthrough science into breakthrough medicines.</strong></p>
  <p>Through harnessing the power of cell rejuvenation we aim to restore cell health and resilience and ultimately reverse disease. We focus on bringing together discovery and translation, so that the progress we make in the lab has the potential to change peoples’ lives for the better.</p>

  <h2>Alcor: The World Leader in Cryonics</h2>
  <p><em>Retrieved from <a href="https://www.alcor.org/press/alcor-fact-sheet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">alcor.org/press/alcor-fact-sheet</a></em></p>

  <p>The Alcor Life Extension Foundation, a nonprofit organization founded in 1972, is the world leader in cryonics and cryonics technology. Cryonics is the science of using ultra-cold temperatures to cryopreserve human life. The promise of cryopreservation has taken a leap forward with the introduction of vitrification (ice-free cryopreservation) to Alcor’s protocols.</p>

  <p>Cryonics is based on the anticipation that technologically advanced scientific procedures and molecular nanotechnology will one day be available to restore cryopreservation patients to good health. With molecular nanotechnology, it is anticipated that cell-sized machines will be developed in the future to repair damage or cure aging and disease at the cellular level, including any potential damage from the cryopreservation process itself.</p>

  <p>Alcor operates under the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act and performed its first human cryopreservation in 1976. Many people cover the cost of cryopreservation at Alcor services with affordable life insurance naming Alcor as the policy beneficiary.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Whole-body cryopreservation: $220,000</li>
    <li>Neuropreservation (brain-only): $80,000</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Alcor offers “Deployment and Recovery Team (DART)” services whereby a trained team is available nearby a terminal person’s bedside or hospital room, ready to act if Alcor’s services are required. Similar to organ transplants, time is of the essence to give the person the best possible chance of receiving good cryopreservation.</p>

  <p>Today, Alcor is the only full-service cryonics organization in existence. Alcor has a medical advisory board, a scientific advisory board, a board of directors, and a patient care trust board. There are over 1500 Alcor members from around the world, and over 250 patients cryopreserved at Alcor.</p>

  <h4>Notes on Cryonics (from Workshop Facilitators)</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Cryonics refers to the preservation of a human body or brain at extremely low temperatures shortly after death, in the hope that future scientific advances may enable revival and healing.</li>
    <li>While current technologies successfully freeze and revive biological materials such as sperm, eggs, and embryos, the revival of a cryopreserved human remains beyond today’s scientific capability.</li>
    <li>Supporters of cryonics contend that, although current methods cannot restore life, there is likewise no conclusive evidence that such revival will be impossible in the future.</li>

  <h2>Avatar: International Manifesto of the “2045” Strategic Social Initiative</h2>
  <p><em>Retrieved from <a href="http://www.2045.com/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2045.com/about</a></em></p>

  <p>Mankind has turned into a consumer society standing at the edge of a total loss of the conceptual guidelines necessary for further evolution. The majority of people are almost exclusively absorbed in merely maintaining their own comfortable lives.</p>

  <p>Modern civilization, with its space stations, nuclear submarines, iPhones, and Segways, cannot save mankind from the limitations in the physical abilities of our bodies, nor from diseases and death.</p>

  <p>We are not satisfied with the modern achievements of scientific and technical progress. Science working for the satisfaction of consumer needs will not be able to ensure a technological breakthrough towards a radically different way of life.</p>

  <p><strong>The new ideology</strong> should assert, as one of its priorities, the necessity of using breakthrough technology for the improvement of man himself and not only of his environment.</p>

  <p>We believe that it is possible and necessary to eliminate aging and even death, and to overcome the fundamental limits of the physical and mental capabilities currently set by the restrictions of the physical body.</p>

  <p>Scientists from various countries are already developing technology that ensures the creation of an artificial human body prototype within the next decade. We believe the biggest technological project of our times will become the creation of such an artificial human body and a subsequent transfer of individual human consciousness to such a body.</p>

  <p>Implementation of this technological project will inevitably result in an explosive development of innovations and global changes in our civilization, and will improve human life.</p>

  <p>We believe that before 2045, an artificial body will be created that will not only surpass the existing body in terms of functionality but will also achieve perfection of form and be no less attractive than the human body. People will make independent decisions about the extension of their lives and the possibilities for personal development in a new body after the resources of the biological body have been exhausted.</p>

  <p>The new human being will receive a huge range of abilities and will be capable of withstanding extreme external conditions easily: high temperatures, pressure, radiation, lack of oxygen, etc. Using a neural-interface, humans will be able to operate several bodies of various forms and sizes remotely.</p>

  <p><strong>We suggest</strong> the implementation of not just a mechanistic project to create an artificial body, but a whole system of views, values, and technology which will render assistance to humankind in intellectual, moral, physical, mental, and spiritual development.</p>

  <p>We invite all interested specialists: scientists, politicians, mass media personalities, philosophers, futurologists and businessmen to join the “2045” strategic social initiative. We welcome all who share our vision of the future and are ready to make the next jump.</p>
